# Input-script
Linux shell input script with python integration


First we have the shell script, which takes two inputs, and saves them as a .txt file.
Afterwards it runs the .py script.

The .py script opens the mentioned .txt file and loads it as as string. Then it counts how many times each letter has been written.
